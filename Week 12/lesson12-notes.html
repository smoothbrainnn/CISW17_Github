  <h2 class="w3-red">Lesson 25: JavaScript Best Practices</h2>

  <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson</p>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>Best practices for creating unobtrusive scripts</li>
    <li>The importance of separating content, presentation, and behavior</li>
    <li>The importance of following web standards to create cross-browser scripts</li>
    <li>How to read and display browser information</li>
    <li>How to use feature sensing to avoid errors</li>
    <li>How to support older, less compliant browser versions</li> 
    <li>How to support non-JavaScript browsers</li> 
  </ul>

  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    When creating scripts for webpages, there are best practices to adhere to unobtrusive scripting, which
    refers to creating scripts that are easy to maintain and use. The first guideline to achieving this is
    to only use JavaScript when necessary and see if a desired result can be achieved with HTML or CSS.
    Another guideline is to keep your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files separate so a webpage can be easily
    maintained and modified. In order to keep webpage loading times low, a third guideline is to link your
    JavaScript file after your HTML code so that the webpage can be rendered before any scripts load, and
    to keep your JavaScript code to one file, if possible. A final guidelines is to implement progressive
    enhancement and graceful degradation to ensure compatibility with the widest range of devices, 
    including devices using browsers not using JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is recommended to use the <code>addEventListener</code> method to keep JavaScript separate from 
    HTML code and to have the ability to attach multiple events to execute with a single event. You can
    add multiple if statements to attach events in a specific way depending on browser. There are certain
    web standards that you should adhere to, including having web code that is broswer agnostic, robust
    error handling, and documenting your code. Other standards include ensuring usability and accessibility
    with the user, implementing design patterns that the user will recognize, and reusing code by abstraction.
    You can use the <code>navigator</code> object to obtain information about the browser used to load a
    webpage, and you can cater your JavaScript code for older browsers that might not be compatible with
    generic code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of using the <code>navigator</code> to sense browser information, you can use if statements
    to sense features. Checking for attach events methods is an example of sensing features. Despite most
    broswers supporting JavaScript, there are some who don't, or some who turn on JavaScript in the ones
    that do. In those cases, the <code>noscript</code> tag is available to display a message. It is
    highly recommended to that to achieve unobtrusive scripting, JavaScript should be optional unless
    absolutely necessary, and a webpage can still function without it.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    This lesson proved to be useful to me in terms of having a design philosophy for JavaScript. The first
    this I will do is keep JavaScript to a minimum to keep webpage performance at a maximum. I will also
    have an external JavaScript file so the file can be ignored for those who do not have JavaScript
    enabled. Having generic code that works with multiple broswers, and only using feature sensing
    or the <code>navigator</code> object for certain use cases, is another guideline I will adhere to.
    Finally, another specific thing that I will do often when coding JavaScript is to use abstraction often
    so that I can reuse code as much as possible.

  <h2 class="w3-red">Lesson 26: Using Third-Party JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</h2>

  <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson</p>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>Why you might use a third-party JavaScript library or framework</li>
    <li>The differences between libraries and frameworks</li>
    <li>How and when you might use Angular, jQuery, React, and other third-party libraries</li>
    <li>How to download and use a popular third-party JavaScript library in your applications</li>
    <li>The benefits of JavaScript frameworks</li>
  </ul>

  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    Third-party JavaScript libraries are an extension of the built-in objects in JavaScript: they help
    a web developer to accomplish a complex task using a function that's already been created. Although
    not without drawbacks, using third-party libraries means you'll be using code that is likely
    well-tested and well-documented, and helps cut down on development time. One well-known third-party
    library is jQuery, which is available both for download and for remote host use by Google. To access
    a web element or class in jQuery, you use the "$" character and enclose the element or class in
    parentheses and then in quotes. You also precede the name of the element with a "#" and "." for classes.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can use "." to activate a method on jQuery object just like with a normal object. Another
    well-known library is called Prototype, which improves basic JavaScript syntax and code, and
    and can be downloaded or accessed remotely. Another notable library is script.aculo.us, a
    spinoff of Prototype, which is used to simplify coding animations and transitions. A couple
    more popular JavaScript libraries include Dojo and MooTools. Like with a custom made external
    script, you use the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>script</code> tag to add a 
    third party library.
  </p>

  <p>
    Compared to Javascript libraries, JavaScript frameworks are larger, more complicated, and
    enforces a specific architectural pattern. One model, the model-view-controller pattern,
    divides an application into three parts: one that holds information, one that requests
    information, and one that sends information. In this model, a user manipulates the model such
    that the view requests information from the controller, which sends the requested information
    back to the model. Many JavaScript frameworks exist, including Angular, Backbone.js, Ember, 
    Knockout, and React.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter Reflection</h3>

  <p>
    This lesson opened my eyes to the usefulness of third-party JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
    By using third-party JavaScript code, I can cut down on development time by using enhanced code
    that is well-documented and often has simpler, more intuitive syntax. jQuery mobile is of 
    particular interest, since many internet users are accessing webpages on their mobile devices.
    I will also use CDN version of the libraries instead of downloading for hosting, due to the 
    performance increase. The MVC model is an intresting model that will prove useful to keep in 
    mind as I use these third-party libaries.
