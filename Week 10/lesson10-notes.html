  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    Three important aspects of JavaScript programming are variables, strings, and arrays. Variables can
    store data and have several rules regarding its naming, including only having letters, numbers and
    the underscore character, and starting with a letter or the underscore character, and fitting
    variable name on one line. Where  variables can be used is based on scope: global variables can be 
    called anywhere, but local variables can only be used within a function that the are crated in. 
    While using <code>var</code> is optional for global variables, it is a good practice to use 
    <code>var</code> for declaring all variables. There are several ways to incrementing or decrementing 
    variables, including using <code>+=</code>/<code>-=</code> and <code>++</code>/<code>--</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript uses common arithmetic operators and the modulo operator to perform operations, and it
    operates by arithmetic precendence rules. The most common data types used in JavaScript are numbers
    boolean, string, and null. A JavaScript variable can store more than one type of data after it's 
    declared, i.e. it can store a number and later store a string. JavaScript usually handles conversion
    between data types as necessary, but there are some methods, <code>parseInt</code> and 
    <code>parseFloat</code>, that converts a number stored as a string, as a numerical value. String 
    variables can be declared with either <code>var</code> or the <code>new</code> keyword, which is 
    use to create new objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    The addition operator, <code>+</code>, can be used to combine, or concatenate, strings, as well as 
    the increment operator <code>+=</code>. Common methods used with a string object include the 
    <code>length</code> method, which outputs the number of characters in a string, <code>toUpperCase</code> 
    and <code>toLowerCase</code>, which converts all characters to upper case and lower case respectively, and 
    <code>substring</code>, which accesses a certain part of a string. Other notable string methods include 
    <code>charAt</code>, which returns the character at a specified index, and <code>indexOf</code>, which
    returns the index of a specified substring in a string. Arrays are a type of object consisting of a 
    group of data items, including numbers or strings. You can declare a new array with the <code>new</code>
    word, or simply specify a new variable name and assign the array's contents within brackets 
    ("<code>[]</code>").
  </p>

  <p>
    Like strings, arrays have a <code>length</code> method, which gives you the number of items, or elements, 
    in the array. You can access an array element of specifying the name of the array and the index of the 
    element in brackets. For string arrays, you can use <code>split</code> to take a string with spaces and
    split it into a string array for all strings between spaces. <code>join</code> allows you to join 
    elements of a string array into one string. Another array method, <code>sort</code> allows you to 
    arrange an array in alphabetical order. 
  </p>

  <p>
    To sort numerical arrays, you insert a number comparison function so the sort function knows if one
    number belongs before or after another. Speaking of functions, they are a group of JavaScript statements
    that are grouped together and be called by its name. Functions can have parameters, which are variables
    that are passed from the main HTML page into the function for operations. Functions can also have 
    return values, which will be substituted for the calling function. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides DOM objects and the built-in objects like strings and arrays, you can also define custom objects.
    You define a function, referred to as a constructor in this context, to create a custom object. Any 
    parameters defined in the function can be used initialize the values of the object's properties. If you
    want the parameters and the property's name to be the same, you must use the <code>this</code> keyword
    to distinguish the parameters of an object and the properties of the object. To define a method for an 
    object, you must define a separate function then assign the function to a method of the object.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using the <code>prototype</code> keyword, you can define a new function or variable and assign it as
    a new variable and method of an existing object. An important built-in JavaScript object is the 
    <code>Math</code> object. Some methods included in the <code>Math</code> object include the 
    <code>ceil</code>, <code>floor</code>, and the <code>round</code> methods, which rounds up, rounds down, 
    and rounds a number to the nearest integer respectively. Another important method is the 
    <code>random</code> method, which generates a random number between 0 and 1. Another important object for 
    JavaScript is the <code>Date</code> object which can store dates in several formats. There are many 
    methods for setting dates, accessing parts of a date object, and converting date object to strings.

  <h3>Rules for choosing variable names</h3>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>Variable names can only include letters of the alphabet, numbers, or the underscore 
    character.</li>
    <li>The first character of the variable name must be either a letter or 
    an underscore.</li>
    <li>Variable names are case sensitive; for example, <code>totalnum</code>, 
    <code>Totalnum</code>, and <code>TotalNum</code> are interpreted as 
    separate variable names.</li>
    <li>There is no official limit on the length of a variable name, but it 
    must fit on one line.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Global and local variables</h3>
  <p> Global variables can be called anywhere, but local variables can only be used within a function that 
  the are crated in. </p>

  <h3>Ways to assign value to variables</h3>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>Using the keyword <code>var</code></li>
    <li>Using the keyword <code>let</code></li>
    <li>Using the keyword <code>const</code></li> 
    <li>Using no keyword and assigning a value to a variable name (for global variables)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ways to increment and decrement variables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the assignment operator to take a variable and add or subtract a new value (x = x + 1,
    x = x - 1)</li>
    <li>Using the shorthand operators <code>+=</code>/<code>-=</code> which are equivalent to the above
    value assignment examples respectively (x += 1, x -= 1)</li>
    <li>Using the shorthand operators <code>++</code>/<code>--</code> which are equivalent to 
    incrementing or decrementing a variable by 1 only, respectively.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>JavaScript Data Types</h3>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>Numbers</li>
    <li>Boolean</li>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Null (for undefined variables)</li> 
  </ul>

  <h3>What is a <code>string</code> object?</h3>
  <p>
    A string object is a group of data and methods associated with a string, which is a group of characters.
  </p>

  <h3>What is an array?</h3>
  <p>
    An array is a numbered group of data items of the same data type.
  </p>

  <h3>What is a function?</h3>
  <p>
    A function is a group of statements in a block that can be called and reused multiple times in code.
  </p>

  <h3>How to return a value from a function</h3>
  <p>
    To return a value from a function, you use the <code>return</code> keyword as the last line in the 
    function, followed by the value you want to return. You'll need to pass at least one value as a 
    parameter in a function to return a value.
  </p>

  <h3>What is an object?</h3>
  <p>
    A object is a group of data items, which can be of multiple data types, and functions that are 
    usually related together logically.
  </p>

  <h3>What is a <code>Math</code> object?</h3>
  <p>
    A math object is a group of common mathematical constants, like pi, and operations, like rounding
    and generating random number.
  </p>

  <h3>What is a <code>Math</code> object?</h3>
  <p>
    A math object is a group of common mathematical constants, like pi, and operations, like rounding
    and generating a random number between 0 and 1.
  </p>

  <h3>How to generate a random number between 1 and n?</h3>
  <p>The following code allows you to generate a random number between 1 and n:</p>
  <code>Math.ceil(Math.random() * n);</code>
  <p>or</p>
  <code>Math.floor(Math.random() * n) + 1;</code>

  <h3>What is a <code>Date</code> object?</h3>
  <p>
    A date object is a group of date properties and methods that allows you to store dates in multiple
    formats, output and modify parts of the date object, and to convert the date object to a string.
