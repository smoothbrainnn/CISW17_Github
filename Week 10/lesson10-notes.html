  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    JavaScript is a very popular scripting language used in web browsers that runs client-side as 
    opposed to server-side. Like with CSS, JavaScript can be included on a website via an external
    .js file or directly in the main HTML file using the &lt;script&gt; tag. JavaScript can be used
    to create dynamic content on a webpage, such as loading a random quote every time the page is
    loaded. An important part of JavaScript is the use of arrays, which are data scructures that
    contain a list of similar things, like quotes, fruits, or cars. Other common JavaScript scripts
    include the concatenation operator "+" to combine strings, and Math functions like "Math.floor()"
    and "Math.random()" to generate random numbers. Yet another common use of JavaScript is to
    manipulate the document object model (DOM) to dynamically change the appearance of a webpage. DOM
    is a framework in JavaScript allows you to access and change a web element dynamically.
  </p>

  <p>
    One approach to imprementing JavaScript, Unobstrutive JavaScript, requires that JavaScript on a
    webpage should be usable, easily degradable, accessible, and separate from HTML and CSS. This
    approach allows to be effective in delivering dynamic web content across a wider range of devices. 
    Using an ID attribute in HTML allows you to separate the script from the main HTML, and you can
    reference the HTML element using the DOM. The "onclick" attribute in an HTML tag allows you to tie 
    JavaScript to a user click on a page. Developing a modern website requires the combination of the 
    latest features of HTML5 and JavaScript that not only loads dynamic content on the webpage, but 
    also communicates with server-side languages to fetch content from a server.
