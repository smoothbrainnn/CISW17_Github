  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    Controlling the flow in which code executes is very important for programming code, and JavaScript is
    no different. The most common flow control statement is the <code>if</code> statement, which evaulates
    a boolean expression, also called a conditional expression, and execute the block of code within the 
    statement if it evaluates to true. Conditional expressions are built with conditional operators, and
    multiple conditional expressions can be chained together with logical operatorsas one complex
    conditional expression. You can use the <code>else</code> keyword to execute code when the conditional
    expression in the previous if statement is evaulated to false. There are shorthand conditional
    expressions that you can use for simple if-else statements, which are useful if you want to assign
    a variable to a certain value depending on the conditional expressions.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need to control flow of code for multiple conditions (>2 conditions), you can use 
    <code> else if</code> to add conditions besides the initial <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> 
    statements. As an alternative to the if-else statements, you can the <code>switch</code> to combine
    multiple if-else statements into one block of code, given they share a variable or expression in 
    common. Another important way to control the flow of code is the loop, and the <code>for</code>
    keyword allows to execute a block of code a specified number of times. Another set of loops, the
    <code>while</code> and the <code>do...while</code> execute an indefinite of times, only stopping
    when a conditional expression is false. The difference between the <code>while</code> and
    <code>do...while</code> loop is that the latter loop executes the block of code at least once
    before checking a conditional expression to execute the code again.
