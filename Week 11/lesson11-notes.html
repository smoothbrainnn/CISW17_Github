  <h2 class="w3-red">Lesson 23: Controlling Flow with Conditions and Loops</h2>

  </ul>

  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    Controlling the flow in which code executes is very important for programming code, and JavaScript is
    no different. The most common flow control statement is the <code>if</code> statement, which evaulates
    a boolean expression, also called a conditional expression, and execute the block of code within the 
    statement if it evaluates to true. Conditional expressions are built with conditional operators, and
    multiple conditional expressions can be chained together with logical operatorsas one complex
    conditional expression. You can use the <code>else</code> keyword to execute code when the conditional
    expression in the previous if statement is evaulated to false. There are shorthand conditional
    expressions that you can use for simple if-else statements, which are useful if you want to assign
    a variable to a certain value depending on the conditional expressions.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need to control flow of code for multiple conditions (>2 conditions), you can use 
    <code> else if</code> to add conditions besides the initial <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> 
    statements. As an alternative to the if-else statements, you can the <code>switch</code> to combine
    multiple if-else statements into one block of code, given they share a variable or expression in 
    common. Another important way to control the flow of code is the loop, and the <code>for</code>
    keyword allows to execute a block of code a specified number of times. Another set of loops, the
    <code>while</code> and the <code>do...while</code> execute an indefinite of times, only stopping
    when a conditional expression is false. The difference between the <code>while</code> and
    <code>do...while</code> loop is that the latter loop executes the block of code at least once
    before checking a conditional expression to execute the code again.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should be careful with loops, especially with <code>while</code> and <code>do...while</code>
    loops, because if the condition expression isn't properly define, then you'll have an 
    infinite loop. The keyword <code>break</code> helps you exit a loop statement, regardless of
    whether the condition expression has become false. <code>continue</code> is a keyword that allows
    you to start at the top of the loop block, regardless of other code below it. Another type of loop
    allows you to use the <code>for</code> statement to navigate properties of an object. Loops are
    commonly used to traverse arrays.

  <h2 class="w3-red">Lesson 24: Responding to Events and Using Windows</h2>

  <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson</p>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>How event handlers work</li>
    <li>How event handlers relate to objects</li>
    <li>How to create an event handler</li>

    <li>How to display alerts, confirmations, and prompts</li> 
  </ul>

  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    A script that you create and use to detect and respond to an event, like a user clicking a button,
    is generally referred to as an event handler. Event handlers can be directly embedded as an 
    attribute to a web element and can also call functions in JavaScript. To add multiple functions
    to trigger in response to an event, you can trigger them using the <code>addEventListener</code> 
    method, which has several events that the object can "listen" for, from the DOM object. A built-in
    object, <code>event</code>, can help you modify the listening event such that a function or code
    only triggers when certain keys are pressed, or on a certain part of the page. Common events
    for which you can add event listeners is moving the mouse over a web element, clicking on a link,
    pressing a key, and loading a webpage.
  </p>

  <p>
    A common command to execute in reponse to an event is changing the appearance of a web element in
    a <code>div</code>, such that certain certain context is shown or hidden when clicked. The 
    <code>Window</code> object allows you to change the properties of the window that a web page is
    opened in, including closing windows and opening new windows. One use case of the <code>Window</code> 
    object is resizing and moving the windows using the <code>moveTo</code>, <code>moveBy</code>, 
    <code>resizeTo</code>, and <code>resizeBy</code> methods. Another useful method of the 
    <code>Window</code> object is the <code>setTimeout</code> method, which allows to delay the
    execution of code after a defined amount of time. Finally, there are methods for providing dialog
    boxes to simply show messages, confirm a user event, and to prompt the user for text input.

  <h2 class="w3-red">JavaScript Conditions, Loops, and Event Handlers Reference</h2>

  <h3 class ="w3-panel w3-blue w3-round-xlarge">What is a conditional statement?</h3>
  <p>
    A conditional statement is a line or block of code that only executes when a certain criteria is 
    met, usually a comparison of numerical values.
  </p>

  <h3 class ="w3-panel w3-blue w3-round-xlarge">The conditional operators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>== — Is equal to</li>
    <li>!= — Is not equal to</li>
    <li>&lt; — Is less than</li>
    <li>&gt; — Is greater than</li>
    <li>&gt;= — Is greater than or equal to</li>
    <li>&lt;= — Is less than or equal to</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class ="w3-panel w3-blue w3-round-xlarge">An example of multiple conditional expressions</h3>
  <p>
    Multiple conditional expressions can be chained together for a single conditional
    statement using the logical operators <code>&&</code> and <code>||</code>. An
    example is shown below.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    if ((phone == "") || (email == "")) {
      alert("Something Is Missing!");
    }
  </code></pre>

  <h3 class ="w3-panel w3-blue w3-round-xlarge">A use case of loops</h3>
  <p>
    A use case of loops is to repeatedly prompt the user to enter information until the user enters
    a special character to indicate that they finished entering information.
  </p>

  <h3 class ="w3-panel w3-blue w3-round-xlarge">What is an event handler?</h3>
  <p>
    An event handler is a script that is executed in response to an event, such as user moving the
    mouse over a certain location, or clicking on something.
  </p>


  <h3 class ="w3-panel w3-blue w3-round-xlarge">"Click" event handler example</h3>
  <p>
    The following example shows a function <code>mousealert</code> that is triggered when a web
    element with an id of <code>link1</code> is clicked on:
  </p>

  <code>document.getElementById("link1").addEventListener("click", mousealert);</code>

  <h3 class ="w3-panel w3-blue w3-round-xlarge">How can you make your page listen for keystrokes?</h3>
  <p>
    You can have your webpage listen for keystrokes by adding an event listener for 
    <code>keypress</code> or <code>keydown</code> and defining a function with a conditional 
    statement that looks for the desired keystroke. <code>event.key</code> can be used to "listen"
    for the desired key.
  </p>

  <h3 class ="w3-panel w3-blue w3-round-xlarge">The properties of the <code>Window</code> object</h3>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>
      <code>window.closed</code> — Indicates whether the window has been closed. This makes sense 
      only when you’re working with multiple windows because the current window contains the script 
      and cannot be closed without ending the script.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>window.opener</code> — In a new window opened by a script, provides a reference to the 
      window containing the script that opened it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>window.outerHeight</code> and <code>window.outerWidth</code> — Specify the height and 
      width, respectively, of the outside of a browser window.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>window.screen</code> — Provides a child object that stores information about the screen 
      the window is in—its resolution, color depth, and so on.
    </li>
    <li><code>window.self</code> — Acts as a synonym for the current window object.</li>
  </ul>
