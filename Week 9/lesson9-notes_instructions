## Add CSS and Styling Elements

We will start using [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) as a standard template to build from. Create a stylesheet link to use W3.CSS.

Open the [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) site and follow the instructions to add your stylesheet.

Select a [W3.CSS color class](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_colors.asp) for your headings, and add that in either your style tag or directly in the h2 class.

Use [W3.CSS lists](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_lists.asp) to create bordered lists on your page.

Ensure that your page is mobile responsive.

Ensure that your page can be easily read when the browser is full screen.

Ensure that your website is centered in the browser.
