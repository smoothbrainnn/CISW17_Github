  <h2 class="w3-red">Lesson 19: Understanding Dynamic Websites and HTML5 Applications</h2>

  <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson</p>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>How to conceptualize different types of dynamic content</li>
    <li>How to include JavaScript in your HTML</li>
    <li>How to display randomized text with JavaScript</li>
    <li>How to change images by using JavaScript and user events</li>
    <li>How to begin thinking ahead to putting all the pieces together to create HTML5 
    applications</li>
  </ul>

  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    JavaScript is a very popular scripting language used in web browsers that runs client-side as 
    opposed to server-side. Like with CSS, JavaScript can be included on a website via an external
    .js file or directly in the main HTML file using the &lt;script&gt; tag. JavaScript can be used
    to create dynamic content on a webpage, such as loading a random quote every time the page is
    loaded. An important part of JavaScript is the use of arrays, which are data scructures that
    contain a list of similar things, like quotes, fruits, or cars. Other common JavaScript scripts
    include the concatenation operator "+" to combine strings, and Math functions like "Math.floor()"
    and "Math.random()" to generate random numbers. Yet another common use of JavaScript is to
    manipulate the document object model (DOM) to dynamically change the appearance of a webpage. DOM
    is a framework in JavaScript allows you to access and change a web element dynamically.
  </p>

  <p>
    One approach to imprementing JavaScript, Unobstrutive JavaScript, requires that JavaScript on a
    webpage should be usable, easily degradable, accessible, and separate from HTML and CSS. This
    approach allows to be effective in delivering dynamic web content across a wider range of devices. 
    Using an ID attribute in HTML allows you to separate the script from the main HTML, and you can
    reference the HTML element using the DOM. The "onclick" attribute in an HTML tag allows you to tie 
    JavaScript to a user click on a page. Developing a modern website requires the combination of the 
    latest features of HTML5 and JavaScript that not only loads dynamic content on the webpage, but 
    also communicates with server-side languages to fetch content from a server.
  </p>

  <h2 class="w3-red">Lesson 20: Getting Started with JavaScript Programming</h2>
  <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson</p>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>How and why to organize scripts using functions</li>
    <li>What objects are and how JavaScript uses them</li>
    <li>How JavaScript can respond to events</li>
    <li>How and when to use conditional statements and loops</li>
    <li>How browsers execute scripts in the proper order</li>
    <li>Basic syntax rules for avoiding JavaScript errors</li>
    <li>What JSON is and how it can be used</li>
  </ul>

  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    Statements, sections of code that performs a single action, are the basic units of a JavaScript
    program, and they can be combined as a single unit called a function. Functions can be called
    by themselves or can be called with expressions, also known as parameters. Data can be stored in
    variables with "var", the name of the variable, and the value the variable it's assigned. Both 
    data and functions can be stored in objects, which are data constructs that can represent tangible
    things like people, or abstract things like math and dates. You can create your own custom objects
    or use pre-made objects. 
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript supports conditional statements, which contains code that only executes if a certain
    criteria is met, and also supports loops, which contain code that maybe execute multiple
    consecutive times depending on defined criteria. Event handlers work similarly to if statements, 
    but they execute code based on user interaction rather than variable data. Scripts contained in 
    the &lt;head&gt; tag are executed before scripts in the &lt;body&gt; tag, and event handlers
    only execute when their event occurs. JavaScript follows certain rules of syntax, such as its 
    keywords only being lowercase, built-in objects being uppercase, DOM objects following camel
    casing, and variable names only starting with the underscore character or a letter. There are 
    best practices when writing JavaScript, such as making a lot of comments with "//" and "/**/",
    restricting, using a semicolon to mark the end of a statement, using external JavaScriptf files
    as much as possible, keeping JavaScript browser-agnostic, and to keeping JavaScript to optional
    web enhancements that don't affect core functionality of a web page. Finally, JSON, or JavaScript
    Object Notation, is a streamlined way to store data in a special object that pairs parameters with
    its corresponding value.

  <h2 class="w3-red">Lesson 21: Working with the Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
  <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson</p>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-border w3-sand">
    <li>How the W3C DOM standard makes dynamic pages easier to control</li>
    <li>The basics of the standard DOM objects: window, document, history, and location</li>
    <li>How to work with DOM nodes, parents, children, and siblings</li>

  </ul>
  
  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    The document object model, or DOM, is a hierarchy of objects that represent the web browser and the 
    web document, i.e. the web page. At the top of the hierarchy is the window object, representing the
    broswer window, and important objects below the window object are the document, location, history,
    and the navigator objects. The document object represents the web document, and by using the "."
    operator, you can access properties of the web document, including its URL, title, last modified
    date, and images in the document. Other important properties of the web document include the write
    method, which writes text to the web document, and the link object, a child object of document which 
    stores data about links on the page. The history object keeps track of the pages that have been visited
    in the web browser, and contains methods to navigate forward, backward to jump directly to those pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another window child object, location, provides information about the URL of the currently loaded webpage,
    including the hostname, port, and pathname and has methods to reload and assign a new URL for the browser.
    Going back to the hierarchy of the DOM, the arrangement of the DOM is in a tree-like pattern, where each
    object can also be described as a node, and all objects share either a parent, child, or sibling 
    relationship with another object. Each node have properties that they all share, including the node's
    name, its value for text nodes, and the HTML content of the node itself. A node has properties and
    methods that relate to other nodes. Important methods for JavaScript programming are in the document node,
    which includes getting a web element by a defined ID (getElementById) so you can change and modify the
    element dynamically.
