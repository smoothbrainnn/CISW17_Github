  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    Creating an attractive and effective website doesn't require building a complex hierarchy of webpages,
    and, depending on the content, could be accomplished with a single webpage. Having a single page for 
    your website has the advantage of fast loading times, fast navigation, the ability to save the whole
    page to a user's local machine, and simple printing jobs, since all the content is on one page. However,
    in most cases, companies and readers organize their website into short, quickly-read pages that don't
    require scrolling and has a navigation bar to connect the user to any other webpage on the site. The
    fundamental goal of a website is to provide visibility to an individual or organization and to act as
    a portal to the website's content. In order to make your website memoriable, it should have a visual  
    theme that is distinct from other websites, and that theme should be consistent across the webpages of
    the site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Organizing your website, including your navigation bar, is especially important for the largest websites 
    on the internet, such as amazon.com. While there many ways to organize your website, there are several
    guidelines to follow when doing so: deciding where the important content areas are and how to organize
    them, using visual cues and changes to help the user orient themselves on the current webpage, and to try
    to limits your navigation links to seven items or less, or otherwise split them into subcategories of
    seven items or less each. Besides organizing the website itself, another aspect of managing a website is
    SEO, or search engine optimization. Some important factors that improves your ranking in search engines 
    are the following: create interesting content on the site in a variety of media, make navigation easy,
    and optimize your site for mobile devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    When it comes to creating interesting content, it's important that it is full of keywords, is concise and
    comprehensive, is well structured in HTML, has good navigation to other pages, and has other interesting 
    media, like tables, figures and graphs. If you're really committed to SEO, you should also focus on 
    putting LSI, or latent semantic indexing, keywords in your website. While search engines can navigate your 
    website faster than a human, you should still make your navigation easy and intuitive, while avoiding 
    Javascript for navigation if possible. What's also recommended is that you not only have links to other 
    webpages on your site, but also links to other parts of any given webpage for easy navigation to desired 
    content. Since search engines are prioritizing mobile devices for their web results, it is important to
    make sure your webpages are optimized for mobile devices. Guidelines to follow to create mobile-friendly
    webpages is to make them responsive, keep webpages as small as possible in terms of file size, and to
    retain content regardless of device, especially mobile devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another important factor to managing a website is to write maintainable code. A major part of adhering
    to maintenance is documenting it with comments and indenting code to easily see its hierarchy. Version
    control is also a consideration for maintaining code for your website because it allows you to revert
    to a previous version of your webpage code. Other benefits of version control include commiting only 
    certain files of your code, branching your code to have more than one version to experiment with, a
    detailed log of changes from version to version, and both contributing to an open source repository
    or having user contribute code to your repository, if it's open source. There are several version
    control sites out there, with the most popular being Github. An option for customizing your website 
    to your needs is using HTML and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap so you can cut down on development time
    and develop more sophisticated website with simpler code.

  <h3>Chapter Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    Reading this chapter offers a good summation of guidelines that I can follow when developing a website.
    One guideline is to create a website that mobile-friendly, is full of memorable content that is easily 
    navigable, and is light on file size. A big part of creating a good website is to make a robust 
    navigation bar that is easy to understand, and displays where on the website the user is. The previously
    mentioned guidelines will bring you far in search engine optimization, which is something that I need to
    keep in mind when in professional web development. Finally, I will continue to use sites and programs like
    git and github due to its benefits with version control, and consider CSS and HTML frameworks to cut down
    on development time.
