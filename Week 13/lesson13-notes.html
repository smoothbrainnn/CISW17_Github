  <!--Summary-->
  <p>
    An HTML form is a certain section of a webpage where users can input information. In most cases,
    information entered in a form is sent server-side or to a back-end for processing. In a textbox form, 
    a button is either supplied by <code>input</code> tag (when "submit" chosen as <code>type</code>),
    or can be customized by you as an image. In the <code>form</code> tag, you can specify a URL to send
    the inputted information, which is usually a script that dictates how the information will be processed.
    The most popular server-side script to process inputted information is PHP.
  </p>

  <p>
    All HTML forms begin with the <code>form</code> tag, which typically has three attributes: 
    <code>name</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>. <code>method</code> indicates 
    what format the inputted information should be in, document or URL query string, and <code>action</code> 
    is how you specify the URL to send the information. Within the <code>form</code> tag, you place the 
    <code>input</code> tag to prompt the user for information, although the <code>input</code> tag is not
    required to be nested within the <code>form</code> tag. The <code>input</code> tag has the following
    common attribute, <code>name</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>placeholder</code>, <code>required</code>,
    <code>placeholder</code>, and <code>autofocus</code>. Other available attributes for the 
    <code>input</code> include the <code>size</code> and the <code>maxlength</code> attributes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>name</code> attribute in the <code>input</code> tag can also be used as a variable name
    that can be referred to in JavaScript. The <label>tag</label> allows you to add a caption for a 
    <code>input</code> tag and provide additional context for the web element. The <code>fieldset</code>
    and the <code>legend</code> tags are used to provide a caption and context for a grouping of form
    elements, with <code>fieldset</code> defining the group and <code>legend</code> providing the caption
    and context. The <code>type = hidden</code> attribute for <code>input</code> allows you to send
    additional form data that isn't publicly visible to the user on the webpage. Besides the text box,
    there are other form designs you can use to prompt the user to enter data.
  </p>

  <p>
    One common form design is the checkbox, which allows you to check any number of checkboxes, and the
    corresponding data associated with the checked boxes can be stored in an array or as a separate variable
    for each checkbox. The <code>checkbox</code> object has 4 properties: <code>name</code>, <code>value</code>
    for a checked box, <code>defaultChecked</code> to indicate the default state for a checkbox, and 
    <code>checked</code> is specifies the default state and is a boolean value. Another form design is the
    radio button, where a user chooses one choice for a list of options. The radio button object, named
    <code>radio</code>, also has a <code>name</code>, <code>value</code>, <code>defaultChecked</code>, 
    and <code>checked</code> properties, as well as a <code>length</code> property, indicating the number
    of radio buttons. <code>radio</code> is an array object and each individual radio button and its data
    is accessed by an index number. A radio button has a <code>click</code> method and a <code>onClick</code>
    event handler.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet another form design that is commonly used is the selection list, which is defined with the 
    <code>select</code> tag, and the options in the list are defined with the <code>option</code> tag.
    The <code>size</code> attribute for <code>select</code> determines how many items appear before
    scrolling down, and the <code>multiple</code> attribute allows you to select multiple items. The
    <code>select</code> object has the following properties: <code>name</code>, <code>length</code> for
    the number of options and <code>selectedIndex</code> for the index of the currently selected option,
    or the first selected item for multiple selection. The <code>options</code> object has the following
    properties: <code>index</code> for the index of the array, <code>defaultSelected</code> for the state
    of the <code>selected</code> attribute, <code>selected</code> to set the state of the option, 
    <code>name</code>, and <code>text</code> to display text for option. <code>optgroup</code> allows
    you to group options together in custom categories.
  </p>

  <p>
    While <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> can allow you to input one line of text, the 
    <code>textarea</code> tag can allow to input multiple lines of text. <code>textarea</code> has both
    <code>rows</code> and <code>cols</code> attribute that determines the size of the textbox in lines of 
    text, and a scrollbar will appear if you exceed the amount of text that can fit in the display area. 
    Both the <code>text</code> and the <code>textarea</code> object (as well as the <code>select</code>
    object) have the <code>blur</code> and the <code>focus</code> methods, which sets and removes where the
    cursor is respectively. In addition, there is also the <code>select</code> method, which selects all the 
    text in the field, as well as event handlers for focus (<code>onFocus</code>), blur (<code>onBlur</code>),
    select (<code>onSelect</code>), and for modifying text and moving away from the textbox 
    (<code>onChange</code>).
  </p>

  <p>
    There are several other type of form designs available with the <code>input type</code> attribute, 
    including <code>email</code>, <code>file</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>range</code>, 
    <code>search</code>, and <code>url</code>. You can use the <code>datalist</code> tag to add a selection
    of suggested text that the user can click on to input into a textbox. With some of the form designs 
    available in <code>input</code>, data validation is available by default with HTML5, given you don't
    use the <code>novalidate</code> attribute in <code>form</code>. Another form of data validation is
    through the <code>pattern</code> in <code>input</code>, which uses regular expressions to only accept
    input that matches the specified regular expression. It is common to include buttons to submit or clear
    data with <code>submit</code> and <code>clear</code> for the <code>type</code> attribute in 
    <code>input</code>. You can also use <code>type="image"</code> to make a custom button based on an image,
    or use <code>type="button"</code> that does nothing by default when you click on it, so you can add an
    event listener yourself.
  </p> 

  <p>
    The <code>button</code> tag is another way to make buttons to submit information input in a form,
    and also has the <code>reset</code>, <code>button</code> and the <code>button</code> values available
    for the <code>type</code> attribute. With the exception of Internet Explorer and Edge, browsers support
    the <code>output</code> tag where you can describe the output of a form, including any error messages.
    The <code>form</code> object has itself a <code>submit</code> and a <code>reset</code> method, as well
    as event handlers for these actions, <code>onSubmit</code> and <code>onReset</code>. With the
    aforementioned event handlers, you can prevent the data from being submitted or cleared when the
    appropriate button is clicked.
  </p>

  <p>
    To access <code>form</code> objects in JavaScript you can use the <code>document</code> object, and
    the '.' operator to access its derived objects, properties and methods. The brackets "[]" are necessary
    to access a certain index in array objects, like <code>elements</code>. The <code>getElementById</code>
    method will be useful to assign form objects to a variable name so you can write cleaner code.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    This chapter is probably the most important for me when it comes to learning web development. Almost all
    modern websites have sophisticated forms for users to input information for many reasons, like logging in,
    making an account, and entering payment information for online shopping. Of particular interest for me is
    how you access the forms objects, its properties and methods to create robust scripts. Another thing  
    mentioned in the chapter, but will have to look into more, is learning PHP to see how inputted
    information can be processed server-side. The final thing, albeit a small thing, to look into is the 
    <code>optgroup</code> tag to categorize and group selection lists, which can help users input 
    correct information.
